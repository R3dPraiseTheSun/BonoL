Movind the L shaped piece:
	Double click for initializing the start position of the piece,
then draw it on the board game with the cursor in the wanted position.
To confirm, press left click.
Moving the green piece:
	Double click the piece, then double click again on the board game
to place it in the wanted position.
Rules:
	On each turn, a player must first move their L piece, and then may
optionally move one of the neutral pieces. The game is won by leaving
the opponent unable to move their L piece to a new position.
	The pieces can not overlep, and those L shaped most change their position until the end of each turn.
When there is no change made in the allocated time, the opponent wins.
